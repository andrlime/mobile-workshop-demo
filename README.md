# Step 1: Writing your first React Native code
Now that your development environment is set up, you will write your first code in React Native! In this mini project, we will make a simple todo list. The features will include adding new tasks, deleting tasks, editing tasks, and making an aesthetically pleasing design. In Step 1, we will focus on the functionality. In Step 2, we will focus on the design.

To help you not spend too much time thinking about this, we have provided some template code. We will guide you through filling in the blanks. Note that at first, the code might not compile. You will have to fill in some blanks first, and then your app will run.
